## About
Examples of common shell script patterns

This repo is meant as a quick reference for people seeking syntax for common Bash patterns.

For example, you might be writing a script that has to check the exit status of a command and act accordingly.
Or, you may wish to iterate over all files in the current directory with a certain extension.
